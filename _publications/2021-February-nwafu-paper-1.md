title: "Chemometric development using portable molecular vibrational spectrometers for rapid evaluation of AVC (Valsa mali Miyabe et Yamada) infection of apple trees"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2021-February-nwafu-paper-1
excerpt: 'This paper is about using NIR spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy techniques combined with chemometric methods  for detecting different degrees of AVC. Developing a portable spectrometer for AVC disease detection with low cost and high practicality, so as to achieve rapid non-destructive testing in an orchard environment is left for future work.'
