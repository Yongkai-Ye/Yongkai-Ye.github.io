Abstract
======
Grasping is a fundamental capability of various robots, and robotic grippers play a dominant role in grasping since they directly interact with the objects. Current grippers show limited performance when grasping broccoli, raising the demand for non-destructivity and stability. This study presented the design, fabrication, modeling, and testing of a novel pneumatic variable-curvature soft gripper (VCSG) for umbrella-shaped broccoli that mainly comprised three soft variable-curvature fiber-reinforced bending actuators (VCFRBAs). The VCFRBA was inspired and designed by the umbrella-shaped structure of broccoli. An analytical model and finite element method (FEM) were proposed to evaluate the bending deformation of the VCFRBA, achieving a good match with RMSE of below 5.8ยบ. Step response tests of the VCFRBA showed a response time of 0.4 s, which suggested the VCSG had a fast grasping speed. Force experiments demonstrated the VCFRBA can generate a clamping force of 1.13 N with additional lifting forces of 1.38 N. Furthermore, a maximum pull-off force of 35.06 N was measured for the VCSG under the actuation pressure of 0.2 MPa. Results of the grasping experiment showed a 100% success rate and 0% damage rate when the VCSG grasped broccoli samples positioned in an upright position. Broccoli could still be securely grasped when the samples were positioned at different inclined angles. These results demonstrated that the proposed VCSG could grasp umbrella-shaped broccoli with good non-destructivity and stability. This study showcased a novel VCSG, providing a unique solution to grasp broccoli with an umbrella shape for the robotics community.
