<!--Abstract
======
This study presented a method for predicting the bending angle of soft fiber-reinforced bending actuators (SFRBAs) combining the finite element method (FEM) and a nonlinear machine learning algorithm (MLA). Six essential structural parameters of the SFRBA were selected as input variables for the method. An accurate FEM, considering varying actuation pressure, was operated to generate a simulation training dataset of bending angle as output variables. A nonlinear MLA, normalized multilayer perceptron regression (NMLPR), was then extended and optimized to build the relationship. Moreover, transfer learning was deployed to improve the performance of the optimal NMLPR. Experimental measurements were conducted to validate the refined NMLPR, and results demonstrated that the refined NMLPR achieved better performance, yielding an average Root Mean Square Error of 7.935â—¦ and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 6.45%. This work exemplified a methodology that combined FEM and MLA for modeling the SFRBA, paving the way for their further development and practical application  in the control of soft actuators.
