<!--Abstract
======
Current grippers show limited performance when grasping mushrooms with an umbrella shape, raising the demand for a balance between non-destructivity and stability. Soft grippers, integrated with biomimetic approaches, are promising solutions for grasping mushrooms. Inspired by the variable-curvature structure of umbrella-shaped mushrooms, this study presented a biomimetic pneumatic soft gripper (BPSG) that mainly comprised three soft variable-curvature fiber-reinforced bending actuators (VCFRBAs), dedicated to grasping umbrella-shaped mushrooms. The finite element method was employed to predict the deformation of the VCFRBA, and the results showed good matches with the experiments. Step response tests demonstrated the rising time of VCFRBA was 0.46 s, suggesting the proposed BPSG had a fast response speed. Moreover, force experiments indicated that each VCFRBA can generate a clamping force of 1.52 N with an additional lifting force as high as 2.11 N under the actuation pressure of 0.30 MPa. The pull-off forces of 65.23 N were also measured for the BPSG at this pressure. Finally, the results of the grasping experiment showed a 100% success rate and 0% damage rate when the proposed BPSG grasped mushrooms positioned in an upright position, demonstrating good non-destructivity and stability. This study showcased a novel BPSG, providing a unique solution to grasping umbrella-shaped mushrooms for agricultural robots.
