**Object:** Providing a novel pneumatic variable-curvature soft gripper (VCSG) for orientating broccoli.

**Difficulties:** The design and modeling of VCSG.

**Role:** I was with full authority.

**Advisor:** [Prof. Dongdong Du](https://person.zju.edu.cn/Dudd)

**Results:** We presented a novel and efficient variable-curvature soft gripper (VCSG) with the ability to guide the broccoli upright that mainly comprised variable-curvature fiber-reinforced bending actuators (VCFRBAs) and submited a SCI paper named ***"Development of a novel variable-curvature soft gripper used for orientating broccoli in the trimming line"*** to the journal ***"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture"*** for this research (Decision in Process).
